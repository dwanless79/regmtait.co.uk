The Green Care Home needed a new website that helps promote their progressive care home, so they got in touch.

Their previous website had generic copy and vague stock images, so an early decision was to replace the existing stock photos with real photography. I took the time to sketch out the shots we needed. This helped to communicate with the client, and provided clear direction for the photographer, the excellent [Trish Boulton]. Tricia did an amazing job of capturing the light on a gloomy day in mid-January, and worked sensitively among the elderly residents of the care home.

I then cleaned up the branding and developed a simple content strategy, helping to rewrite the provided copy before building the CMS, ExpressionEngine in this case. I worked with html prototypes early on to communicate how the site would work for real, and across different devices.
