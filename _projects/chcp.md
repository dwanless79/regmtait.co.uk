Glass manifestion is required for safety or privacy, yet also provides an opportunity for creativity and design. Working under design direction of RFD [The Red Frog], I created a series of illustrations invoking famous Hull icons, both old and new. I also created a set of artwork featuring photography and key messages.

This piece of work was part of a full interior design and interior architecture for a fantastic new building for the City Health Care Partnership by RFD.
