Here are in the first two of a series of infographics created for Woof Online Marketing on behalf of their client, SkinBase.

An infographic is great way of adding value to an article. I approached these by using the existing SkinBase colours and branding, while introducing crisp graphic design and illustrations. It was fun approaching a feminine subject in this way and I enjoyed creating the illustrations.
