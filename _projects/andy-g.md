Sometimes marketing requires something clear and direct, and this website provides just one key interaction â€“ a great big voting button. There's also some nice social media buttons and a perfectly presented video. It's responsive, meaning it'll look great on every device, including my ancient iPhone 4. This was build for my buddies at [gowoof.co.uk](http://gowoof.co.uk), and for their client, the brilliant [Andrew Geoghegen](http://www.andrewgeoghegan.com/).
