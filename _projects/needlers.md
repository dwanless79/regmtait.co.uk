Needlers UK needed a set of illustrations for a brand new project, so the team got in touch. This was a fun opportunity to focus on illustration as part of a greater project.

I worked with Needlers to determine a suitable illustration styleâ€”and one that could be rendered up efficiently for a relatively large number of illustrations.

I sketched out each one in pencil for two reasons: to confirm them with the client, and to provide a solid foundation for tracing in vector graphics software.

After trying a limited (near-mono) pallete, we moved forward in full colour. I finally exported to SVG 1.1 at two decimal places, ensuring a good balance between file size and image quality.
