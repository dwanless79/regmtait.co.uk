This was a complete rebrand and website build for RFD, an interior design and interior architecture agency in Hull.

I worked very closely with the client throughout the project. We took the time to explore many branding and design concepts, with a focus on cool and highly refined design. We paid attention to every detail, working towards a bespoke and opinionated front-end.

The site has a complete content management system, which makes it very easy to update the content.
