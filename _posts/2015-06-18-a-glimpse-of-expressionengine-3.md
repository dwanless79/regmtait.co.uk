excerpt: I'm excited by a <a href="https://twitter.com/eecms_jimmy/status/611197048654823425" title="James Mathias on Twitter">recent screenshot from James Mathias</a> of <a href="https://ellislab.com/expressionengine" title="ExpressionEngine from EllisLab">ExpressionEngine 3</a>. We can’t judge by a screengrab, but from first impressions it’s beautiful, with a crisp, light and simple interface.

I'm a recent enthusiast of static site generators, with their [wide range of benefits], and like the idea of a 'post-CMS' landscape. But I reckon there will always be space for a high quality, flexible content management system, to help our clients edit their content quickly and easily. ExpressionEngine makes it possible to design the 'back-end' of a site with as much care as the public facing side.

The web landscape has changed a lot since the last 10+ years. Other fine CMSs are available—such as [Perch] and [Craft]—and there and many, many more options for publishing online than a PHP-plus-database combo. ExpressionEngine deserves have a long life ahead of it though, especially with such a great developer community.
