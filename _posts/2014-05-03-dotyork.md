excerpt: I enjoyed attending the <a href="http://dotyork.com/conference/2014/" title="DotYork Conference">DotYork conference</a> at the City Screen in York, on May 1st. The focus was on the personal experiences of the speakers as they followed their chosen paths, rather than anything technical.

It was great seeing so many people from the web community who I've admired through the web, particularly Andy Clarke's [Unfinished Business] podcast. It was good to see [Harry Roberts], who changed my approach to writing CSS, and [Laura Kalbag], whose wise words guided me through starting out as a freelance web designer. I appreciated [Ashey Baxter] describing the recent difficulties in her work, and transforming that into something new.

It was also good having a web conference relatively locally - looking forward to taking part in more events.
