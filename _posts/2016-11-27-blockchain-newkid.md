Today, any log in to a website needs a self-hosted system or social media sign-in. The first can be incredibly insecure, while social media companies don't have our privacy at heart—to say the least. And something as simple as logging into shared wi-fi can be a horror story.

Enter the blockchain. This could eliminate any need for entering traditional user name and password information, and the entities that enforce them. We can own our identities—not Google or Facebook. This points to a faster, safer, and more secure web for all.
