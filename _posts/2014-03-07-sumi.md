excerpt: Does drawing help design? I love to draw, and love to write good markup for well conceived designs, and I wonder if there's an overlap.

For me, a simple pencil feels a lot like a text editor; the most basic tool available with the possibility of doing infinitely sophisticated things. I suppose drawing well is useful for web design in sketching out ideas, but that's not really it for me. It's more of a method for viewing the world clearly and objectively, with any 'style' or 'expression' as a side effect. Clarity and simplicity are essential for good design.
