imagecaption: Hammer – a front end web development tool with a updated interface

excerpt: I'm happy to be using <a href="http://hammerformac.com/" title="Hammer for mac">Hammer</a> again. Hammer is a little front end web tool that's very suited to prototyping. It’s essentially a <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/" title="List of static site generators">static site generator</a> that supports html includes, variables, Sass, Markdown, and other handy stuff.

Hammer had lost it's way a year or two ago since the original developers at Riot moved on. The software languished for a while, eventually falling apart after the last Mac OS update.

A new team at Beach gave it a full refresh and it’s back in action. They’ve also changed to a subscription model.

It's a tricky one for closed source software developers and end users – how to maintain software over time that that a user already ‘owns’. In this case, I’m happy to pay a modest amount to keep something supported and looked after, as it’s something I use for important work.
