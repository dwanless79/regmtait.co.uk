Just a list of quotes that I like.

> If someone has those four things—work ethic, taste, integrity and curiosity—I believe that you can learn anything in the world.
<br><cite>—Matt Mullenweg</cite>

> What are Japan’s resources? I’m particularly thinking about traditional aesthetics. I’ve identified four keywords related to this: sensai (delicateness), chimitsu (meticulousness), teinei (thoroughness or attention to detail) and kanketsu (simplicity).
<br><cite>—[Kenya Hara](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/01/04/general/value-judgments/#.V7Dpi44lCxc 'Kenya Hara interview, Japan Times')</cite>

> The future is not where everyone looks for it, “there,” right after the present. It’s not an integral number in a line: 9, 10, 11…It’s somewhere like 6.8 or 7.3. The new design scene nestled in ordinary life will be created by the intellect that perceives the unlimited numbers between two successive integers.
> <br><cite>—Kenya Hara, Designing Design</cite>

> …exploring the infinite number of notes between C and C sharp…
<br><cite>—Aphex Twin</cite>

> The successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus.
<br><cite>—Bruce Lee</cite>

> Your job as a creator is to engineer simplicity in an otherwise complex system, to leverage technology to reduce the cognitive burden of accomplishing whatever task your user is trying to accomplish… Software should be hard to build and easy to use, not the other way around.
